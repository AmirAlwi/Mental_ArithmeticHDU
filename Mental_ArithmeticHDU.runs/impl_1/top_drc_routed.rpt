2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller_wrapper/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller_wrapper/ref_divisor_reg[2]_i_1/O, cell controller_wrapper/ref_divisor_reg[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller_wrapper/FSM_onehot_current_state_reg[1]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller_wrapper/ready_reg[0]_i_1/O, cell controller_wrapper/ready_reg[0]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller_wrapper/FSM_onehot_current_state_reg[2]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller_wrapper/remainder_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell controller_wrapper/remainder_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller_wrapper/FSM_onehot_current_state_reg[2]_1[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller_wrapper/out_dividend_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell controller_wrapper/out_dividend_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net controller_wrapper/select_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin controller_wrapper/select_reg_i_1/O, cell controller_wrapper/select_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net reg_wrapper/FSM_onehot_current_state_reg[2]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin reg_wrapper/total_quotient_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell reg_wrapper/total_quotient_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
